# Sorting Algorithm Visualizations

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizations repository! This project aims to provide insightful visualizations for various sorting algorithms implemented in Python using matplotlib. Each algorithm is accompanied by step-by-step visualizations to enhance your understanding of the sorting process.

## Overview

### Algorithms

- **Selection Sort:**
  - Description: Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the list and places it at the beginning.

- **Bubble Sort:**
  - Description: Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm that iteratively steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Insertion Sort:**
  - Description: Insertion Sort is a straightforward algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. While less efficient on large lists, it's a foundational sorting method.

- **Merge Sort:**
  - Description: Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into sub-lists, merging them to produce new sorted sub-lists until only one remains.

## Usage
